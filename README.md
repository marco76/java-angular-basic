# Java (Spring Boot) and Angular basic showcase

This version has been updated to:

- Java 21
- Node 20
- Angular 17
- Spring Boot 3.2

As reminder, this is not my preferred approach to a full stack deployment.

This is a quick start for projects using Spring Boot as the backend and Angular as the frontend.

A detailed description can be found in this post:
https://marmo.dev/deploy-java-angular-one

And a demo of the installation in this video:

To the basic example I have added some 'showcases' extra features:
- Test with MockMvc
- Testing with RestTemplateTest
- (Not working yet )OpenApi with Spring Doc (code first). Swagger-ui is available here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui



I will add some basic features like:
- security
- websockets
- ...

The goal is to provide a small application with a full set of features well documented that can be used as inspiration or reference for other projects.

Non-goal are to provide a full set of features or a template that can be used to build other applications (well, you could do it but there is a lot to delete).


## Deprecated
