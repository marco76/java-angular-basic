# Java (Spring Boot) and Angular basic showcase

This is a quick starter for projects using Spring Boot as backend and Angular as frontend.

You find a detailled description in this post:
https://marcomolteni.ch/deploy-java-angular-one

And a demo of the installation in this video:

To the basic example I added some 'showcases' extra features:
- Test with MockMvc
- Test with RestTemplateTest
- OpenApi using Spring Doc (code first). Swagger-ui is accessible here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui


I will add some basic features like:
- security
- websockets
- ...

The goal is to provide a small application with a full set of features well documented that can be used as inspiration or reference for other projects.

Non-goal are to provide a full set of features or a template to be used to build other applications (well, you could do it but there is a lot to delete).

## Branches
Some features are integrated in separate branches:
- Open API example: https://github.com/marco76/java-angular-basic/tree/external-api-open-api
- Build a WAR and not a JAR: https://github.com/marco76/java-angular-basic/tree/feature/war-for-tomcat
- Latest Angular version (13): https://github.com/marco76/java-angular-basic/tree/origin/angular-13-spring-boot-262

## Request a feature
You can contact me or fill a feature request if you would like to see a feature included in this showcase.
